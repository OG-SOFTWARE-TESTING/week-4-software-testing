## 2. Test Strategy

### Black-Box Testing Techniques

| Technique                | Scope                        | Example/Test Case Description                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Equivalence Partitioning | Brand, Price, Storage inputs | Test valid/invalid brands, price ranges      |
| Boundary Value Analysis  | Price, Storage               | Test 64GB, 1024GB, min/max price boundaries  |
| Decision Table Testing   | Filter combinations          | Test combinations of brand + price + storage |

---

### Equivalence Partitioning Report
1. Objective:
   - Verify that the filters works correctly handling both valid and invalid selections by Brand, Price Range and Storage
   
2. Test Item
  - Filter system: Brand dropdown, Price Range dropdown, Storage input field.

3. Partitions
   
| Filter Type   | Input    |
|-----------------|----------------------- |
| Brand | Apple (P1A), Samsung (P1B), Google (P1C), all (P1D) |
| Price($)    | 0-500(P2A), 500-1000(P2B), 1000-1500(P2C), all(P2D) |
| Storage(GB) | 64(P3A), 512(P3B), 1024(P3C), empty(P3D), below range(P3E), above range(P3F)| non-numeric(P3G) |

## 4. Defect Log & GitHub Issues

### Linked GitHub Issues

- [#12:Storage Filter Fails for 512GB and 1024GB](https://github.com/PLP-Database-Design/week-4-rosewanjirukabingu/issues/2)
- [#14: Storage filter requires exact match](https://github.com/PLP-Database-DEPT/swt-w4/issues/14)

### Bug Report 1

title: Storage Filter Fails for 512GB and 1024GB

The storage filter does not display any products when set to 512GB or 1024GB, even though products with these capacities exist in the database.

Steps to Reproduce:

select the brand you want.
Set the storage filter to "512GB" or "1024GB".
Click "Apply Filters"
Expected: Products with storage capacities of 512GB and 1024GB should be displayed depending on which brand is selected.
Actual: no product is displayed.
Severity: High

---

### Bug Report 2

**Title**: Storage filter requires exact match

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Select storage "256GB"
2. Click "Apply Filters"

**Expected**: Should display all products with 256GB storage  
**Actual**: Only displays products if storage is an exact string match  
**Severity**: Low

---

## 5. Reflection

**Challenges Faced:**  
- Ensuring all edge cases (e.g., minimum/maximum price) were tested.
- Interpreting ambiguous filter behaviors (e.g., overlapping ranges).

**Collaboration Benefits:**  
- Group discussions helped uncover bugs that were missed individually.
- Sharing test cases improved overall coverage and efficiency.

**Most Effective Techniques:**  
- Boundary value analysis quickly revealed issues at price/storage limits.
- Decision table testing was useful for complex filter combinations.
